# **Lists**
Lists are just dynamically sized arrays, declared in other languages (vector in C++, ArrayList in java)

List are the collection of things, which are enclosed by `[]` and seperated by the commas.

List is a sequential datatype which is used to store the collection of data. Lists are mutable.

**Example:**
```py
var = ["Geeks", "for", "Geeks"]
print(var)
```

List are simple containers that are an intefral part of the python. A single list may contain datatypes like: Integers, Strings, as well as objects. List are mutable and hence they can be altered even after their creation.

**Example: Creating a basic list**
```py
list = []
print("Blank List: ")
print(list)g

list = [10, 11, 12]
print("List Containing Numbers: ")
print(list)

print("Stanford", "University")
print("List Containing Strings: ")
print(list)
```
