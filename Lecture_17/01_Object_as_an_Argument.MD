# **Object as an Argument**
You can pass objects as arguments to functions or methods. This allows you to manipulate and use the properties and methods of those objects within the function. Here's an explanation along with an example to illustrate how this works.

**Explanation :**
- **Object Creation**: You create an instance of a class (an object).
- **Function Definition**: You define a function that takes an object as a parameter.
- **Accessing Object Attributes and Methods**: Inside the function, you can access the object's attributes and call its methods.
