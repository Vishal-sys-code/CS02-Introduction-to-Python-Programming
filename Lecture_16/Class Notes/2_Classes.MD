# **Classes**
A class is a collection of objects. A class contains the blueprints or the prototype from which the objects are being created. It is a logical entry that contains some attributes and methods.

## **Some important points**
- Classes are created by keyword class.
- Attributes are the variable that belongs to a class.
- Attributes are always public and can be accessed using the dot(.) operator.
eg: `myClass.myAttribute`

**Syntax :-**

```py
class className:
    # Statement 1
    ....
    ....
    ....
    # Statement 2
```

## **Creating an empty class**

```py
class Dog:
    pass
```
