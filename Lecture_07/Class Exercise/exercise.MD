**Exercise 5: Slicing strings**

Take the following Python code that stores a string:

`str = 'X-DSPAM-Confidence: 0.8475'`

Use find and string slicing to extract the portion of the string after the colon character and then use the float function to convert the extracted string into a floating point number.

**Exercise 6: String methods**

Read the documentation of the string methods at `https://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods`. You might want to experiment with some of them to make sure you understand how they work. strip and replace are particularly useful.
The documentation uses a syntax that might be confusing. For example, in find(sub[, start[, end]]), the brackets indicate optional arguments. So sub is required, but start is optional, and if you include start, then end is optional.
