# **Strings**
It is the collection of the characters surrounded by single, doubles, triple quotes. Each character is encoded in the ASCII. 

**REMEMBER:** Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1.

```py
str = 'Hello World'
str_1 = "Hello World"
str_2 = '''Hello World'''

type(str)
type(str_1)
type(str_2)
```
