# **Glossary**

* **body:** The sequence of statements within a compound statement.

* **boolean expression:** An expression whose value is either True or False.

* **branch:** One of the alternative sequences of statements in a conditional statement.

* **chained conditional:** A conditional statement with a series of alternative branches.

* **comparison operator:** One of the operators that compares its operands: ==, !=, >, <, >=, and <=.

* **conditional statement:** A statement that controls the flow of execution depending on some condition.

* **condition:** The boolean expression in a conditional statement that determines which branch is executed.

* **compound statement:** A statement that consists of a header and a body. The header ends with a colon (:). The body is indented relative to the header.

* **guardian pattern:** Where we construct a logical expression with additional comparisons to take advantage of the short-circuit behavior.

* **logical operator:** One of the operators that combines boolean expressions: and, or, and not.

* **nested conditional:** A conditional statement that appears in one of the branches of another conditional statement.

* **traceback:** A list of the functions that are executing, printed when an exception occurs.

* **short circuit:** When Python is part-way through evaluating a logical expression and stops the evaluation because Python knows the final value for the expression without needing to evaluate the rest of the expression.
