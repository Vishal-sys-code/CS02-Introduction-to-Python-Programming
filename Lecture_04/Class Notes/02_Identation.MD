# **Identation**
This is the very important part specially in python language. 

* Increase indent after an `if` or `for` statement [after :]
* Maintain indent to indicate the scope of the block.
* Reduce indent back to the level of the `if` or `for` statement to indicate that the end of the block.
* Blank lines are ignored
* Comment on a line by themselves are ignored with regard to the identation.
