**Exercise 1:** Write a program that uses input to prompt a user for their name and then welcomes them.
```bash
Enter your name: Sam
Hello Sam
```
<hr>

**Exercise 2:** Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour to compute gross pay.
```bash
Enter Hours: 35
Enter Rate: 2.75
Pay: 96.25
```
We won’t worry about making sure our pay has exactly two digits after the decimal place for now. If you want, you can play with the built-in Python round function to properly round the resulting pay to two decimal places.

**Exercise 3:** Assume that we execute the following assignment statements:
```bash
width = 17
height = 12.0
```
For each of the following expressions, write the value of the expression and the type (of the value of the expression).
* width//2
* width/2.0
* height/3
* 1 + 2 * 5

Use the Python interpreter to check your answers.

**Exercise 4:** Write a program which prompts the user for a Celsius temperature, convert the temperature to Fahrenheit, and print out the converted temperature.
* In Python 2, this function was named raw_input.↩︎
