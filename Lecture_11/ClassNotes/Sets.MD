# **SETS**
It is an unordered collection datatype that is iterable, mutable, and has no duplicate element.
Set are represented by `{}` (values enclosed in curly braces)

The major advantage of using a set, as opposed to a list is that it has a highly optimized method for checking whether a specific element is contained in the set.
This is based on a data structure known as **Hash Table**.
Since, Sets are unordered, we cannot access items using indexes as we do in lists.

```py
var = {"Geeks", "Know", "Nerds"}
print(var)
print(ty)
```
